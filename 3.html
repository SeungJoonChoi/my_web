<h2><a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/deque" target="_blank" title="std::deque specification">std::deque</a></h2>
<p>std::deque (double-ended queue) is an indexed sequence container that allows fast insertion and deletion at both its beginning and its end. In addition, insertion and deletion at either end of a deque never invalidates pointers or references to the rest of the elements.</p>
<image src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/dbPA6.jpg" width="100%">
<p style="margin-top:45px;">As opposed to std::vector, the elements of a deque are not stored contiguously: typical implementations use a sequence of individually allocated fixed-size arrays, with additional bookkeeping, which means indexed access to deque must perform two pointer dereferences, compared to vector's indexed access which performs only one.</p>
