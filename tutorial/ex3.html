    <p>
        <span id="first" class="deque">std::deque</span> (double-ended queue) is an indexed sequence <span>container</span> that allows fast insertion and deletion at both its beginning and its end. In addition, insertion and deletion at either end of a <span class="deque">deque</span> never invalidates pointers or references to the rest of the elements.

    <p style="margin-top:45px;">As opposed to std::vector, the elements of a deque are not stored contiguously: typical implementations use a sequence of individually allocated fixed-size arrays, with additional bookkeeping, which means indexed access to deque must perform two pointer dereferences, compared to vector's indexed access which performs only one.</p>
